I finally made it to Javascript! For this project, I created a single page application using javascript for frontend, and Rails API for backend. I wasn't able to add as much to it as I had hoped to, but I created a simple task app. 

One of the most time consuming and confusing parts of the project was the user authentication using JWT token. Luckily my awesome Pod Lead has videos that I was able to follow for help setting it up. After setting up the user auth and the back-end, I started working on the front end.

The user can create, edit, and delete a task. I plan on eventually adding a notes option so that the user can reflect on the task and update their mood for the day.
